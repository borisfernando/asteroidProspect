This project has as principal aim to share knowledge about the Asteroid Belt, which is part of the Solar Sistem and it turns around the Sun, after Mars, therefore around the Earth. But, at any moment it could be dangerous if it diverts some asteroids towards the Earth.

Actually exists some Spaceguard Surveys around the World, whose purpose is to study, discover and observe Near-Earth Objects (NEO), Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) and protect the Earth from the possible threat of their collision. So, this project is based on function of this Spaceguard Centers to avoid collisions which can be a global danger to our planet.
